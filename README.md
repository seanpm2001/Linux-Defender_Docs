## General description

Linux Defender is a computer security suite designed specifically for Linux. It gives off Windows Defender UI/UX aesthetics, but allows more customizations onto the interface. It also contains security info and advisories for many problems, with varying levels of severity. Based on how the program is configured, programs that may seem genuine to some users (such as Google Chrome) can be listed as spyware.

Security advisories are written in `<undefined>` and also in YARA. Linux Defender is designed to work on as many Linux distributions as possible, and has no plans to support Windows, but may provide support for BSD and other UNIX-like systems.
